As discussed with my selected lab partner, our idea is to make a device related to the
video game "Osu! Mania". Osu! Mania is a rhythm game that consists of notes falling
vertically in different lanes. These lanes represent a single keyboard key and a
falling node indicating that the key has to be pressed at this exact time - resulting
in a specific rhythm. Our plan is to make a solenoid that receives input from the
photo interrupter and displays the keys per minute number to a side LED screen.

The project will use multiple Arduinos because we plan on having different
functionalities. For example, an Arduino detects falling notes through the use of a
sensor that sends a signal on the solenoid. Another Arduino for the LED screen, and
more.

In terms of Arduinos/Microcontrollers, it seems that we're going to have an INPUT
and OUTPUT. Our INPUT is the note detection, our OUTPUT could be when we display
things on the LED screen or do solenoid key presses (as we'd need a signal as to
when to click it)

In terms of devices used, our idea is to use a photo interrupter to detect note presses
(subject to change). And, solenoid.

This work is original because it's a video game.
