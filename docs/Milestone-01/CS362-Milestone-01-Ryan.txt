My project idea is a key strokes display and keys per second display.
The key strokes display would show four key columns on an arduino screen, and animates
upwards.

I will use a single arduino system for handling the key strokes animation rendering.
I would then use a second arduino to handle the key per second display rendering.

The computer side will compute the bitmaps and KPS calculations, the transfer method
will be a high baud rate serial connection to each arduino. I believe the computer will
be able to calculate the needed animations, I am simply worried about the rate of refresh
on the screens.

The input device would be a keyboard, and possibly a reset button. The output would be a 
screen display for the key strokes, and 4 leds for currently pressed keys (only four keys
would be tracked).
